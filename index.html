                Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean<br>
                dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online predators, the<br>
                possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and<br>
                countless other threats to their nine lives.

                Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety<br>
                answers crucial questions such as, “What is the right age to talk to my cat<br>
                about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits of my cat<br>
                living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to<br>
                use the internet? Can’t he just play with yarn like cats used to do?”
